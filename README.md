# Product-Description-Generation
Amazon and other e-commerce websites add descriptions for their products manually. To automate this work, I have designed an RNN to generate descriptions based on a product's features. It has been trained on numerous descriptions from jabong.com. It currently works only for generating descriptions for t-shirts, jeans and kurtas. It is not perfect and definitely needs improvement. But it is a skeleton design to base research on. Any improvements and suggestions are welcome. Currently it takes brand, color and style of the apparel item as input for the feature string.
